## 🧠 Highlight Projects

### 🤖 Agentic Chatbot with AWS Bedrock
Built and deployed a custom agentic chatbot using LangChain, AWS Bedrock, and multi-agent fallback strategy with FastAPI and Docker.

### 🖼️ Multimodal Image Similarity System
Developed a Flask API for image comparison using EfficientNetB0 + SSIM + OCR fuzzy matching; reduced manual QC time by 85%.

### 🌍 Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
Built Transformer-based English–Indian and Indian–European translation systems with linguistic collaboration and benchmark tuning (BLEU, COMET).

### 📚 Multimodal RAG + Multi-Agent System
Combined LLaMA 3.2 with LangChain for vision+text retrieval and reasoning with scalable vector DB integration and automated MLOps.

### 📄 FIR Classification for Indian Languages
Created multi-language FIR classifiers using LSTM, BPE tokenization, and normalization techniques to improve legal domain classification.

### 🧠 GPT-based Language Model from Scratch
Trained a domain-specific GPT model in PyTorch using MLOps and deployed with Docker and Kubernetes.
